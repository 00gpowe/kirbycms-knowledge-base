# Kirby Knowledge Base

[Kirby](http://getkirby.com/) is a simple file-based cms, made by [Bastian Allgeier](https://twitter.com/bastianallgeier). At [6Wunderkinder](http://www.6wunderkinder.com) we're using it as an internal knowledge-base for any type of documentation (processes, products, API...). It took us a long time to find the best setup for this and because we think most companies are struggling with this, we decided to open-source it.

## Features

* Markdown Formatting
* Syntax Highlighting
* Search

## How to install?

Installing this is super simple!

1. Download and install [Kirby](http://getkirby.com/)
2. Download/clone this repository and copy over the files into the existing Kirby directories created in step 1.
3. Create your own structure in the *content* folder! We've kept our's for the sake of demonstration, just delete what you don't need.

***Tip:*** We highly recommend to use [Kirby with Dropbox](http://getkirby.com/blog/kirby-meets-dropbox) - locally and on your server and to share the *content* folder with everyone in the team to make editing content extremely simple.

## What we've used to create the knowledge-base

* We've rewritten the [treemenu snippet](<https://github.com/bastianallgeier/kirbycms-extensions/tree/master/snippets/treemenu) to create a simple and clean menu
* We've used the [breadcrumb snippet](https://github.com/bastianallgeier/kirbycms-extensions/tree/master/snippets/breadcrumb)
* We've used the [search plugin](https://github.com/bastianallgeier/kirbycms-extensions/tree/master/plugins/search)
* We've used the [syntax highlighting plugin](https://github.com/bastianallgeier/kirbycms-extensions/tree/master/plugins/highlight)
* We created this simple theme (and got inspired from [Facebook's docs](https://developers.facebook.com/docs))
